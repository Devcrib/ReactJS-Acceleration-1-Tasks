ReactJS Acceleration Tasks

Task A
Problem statement: Using pure Vanilla Javascript (and no known frontend framework whatsoever), create a screen (webpage) that hosts widgets, these widgets are of three kinds, and their behaviours are outlined below:
1. DisplayWidget — a label that displays text.
2. InputWidget — a composite element consisting of an input control and a label (not DisplayWidget).
Data entered into the input becomes automatically previewed in the widget's label.
3. ActionWidget — basically a button that can spawn and destroy InputWidgets when clicked.
Your screen should contain, initially, one DisplayWidget, one InputWidget and two ActionWidgets. A conceptual diagram of the application behaviour is shown in Fig10.
Conditions:
1. UI updates must be as real-time as possible.
2. ES6 Vanilla JS is encouraged.


Task B
Problem statement: Using pure Vanilla Javascript (and no known frontend framework whatsoever), design a shopping checklist app that maintains and remembers the user's list.
   
  
  
Behaviour:
1. Your app on reload, must retain the state the user's checklist was last time they were on it.
2. Your app must provide a means to add new entries to- and to dismiss completed entries on the
checklist.
3. New entries are incomplete by default.
4. Each entry is represented by a labelled checkbox with custom (image) check style.
